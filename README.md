# The Brain Dump

### Overview

Our idea is to make a bulletin board/reddit kind of social media app for all the things you wish you could say, but can't. The users will create a login, and then be directed to a timeline screen where users can post ideas, pictures, or other files that they wish to share on the internet with each post disappearing after 24 hours.
